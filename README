Triangle-Demo
=============

This project #1 of the "Journoob Project". The Journoob Project is an endevour, created by myself, to become a guru in the fields of computer, graphics, and game programming. To accomplish these goals I would like to follow these principles: 
-KISS(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
-YAGNI(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain%27t_gonna_need_it)
-DRY(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

This Triangle Demo is written in C++ and uses OpenGL for 3D Graphics.

Contributions

I have yet to ask for contributions on this project as this is a self endevour. If you would like to attempt a simliar endevour then please contact me so that we could possibly collaborate in some way.
